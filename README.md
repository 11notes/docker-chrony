Run chrony rootless and distroless, secure by default!

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** Run chrony as an NTP server for your network, pure and simple, maximized for performance and security. If you plan to run this in production, make sure you stand up multiple NTP instances and put them behind a load balancer and use virtual IPs.

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION üí∂
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! All the other images on the market that do exactly the same don‚Äôt do or offer these options:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* This image runs as 1000:1000 by default, most other images run everything as root
>* This image has no shell since it is distroless, most other images run on a distro like Debian or Alpine with full shell access (security)
>* This image is created via a secure, pinned CI/CD process and immune to upstream attacks, most other images have upstream dependencies that can be exploited
>* This image contains a proper health check that verifies the app is actually working, most other images have either no health check or only check if a port is open or ping works
>* This image works as read-only, most other images need to write files to the image filesystem
>* This image is a lot smaller than most other images

If you value security, simplicity and the ability to interact with the maintainer and developer of an image. Using my images is a great start in that direction.

# MAIN TAGS üè∑Ô∏è
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [4.7](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/chrony/tags?name=4.7)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is of my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is super dangerous. Many times, I‚Äôve introduced **breaking** changes to my images. This would have messed up everything for some people. If you don‚Äôt want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:4.7``` you can use ```:4```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!
